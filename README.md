# Time Tracking tool

A simple tool to make it quick and easy to record your time. At the end of the week, you can fill in your timesheet from reliable and accurate data.

STATUS: Very much **In Development**

NOTE: This is not my idea, see History below.

# Overview

To use... wait until it's a bit more finished.


# Development

In one terminal, start the dev server:

    node scripts/web-server.js

In another terminal, run the tests:

    ./scripts/test.sh

# History

Many years back I worked as part of the off-shore team on a project, where we were 12-hours different from the customer. Each day we'd arrive to work to a set of questions from the customer, which we'd answer before starting development. At the end of the week, we totted up the time spent on answering questions, development, meetings, etc and send a summary timesheet to the customer. All was good.

I then came across a free [Yahoo! Widget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Widgets) that allowed us to track our time in a simpler way, just taking a few clicks ([widgets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_engine) were all the rage back then). We used it for one week... and then had to phone the customer because our timesheets were so radically different from any before: we were spending far longer answering questions and in meetings than we'd thought.

After the second week, the customer came to realise the true cost of answering those questions, and started to think a lot more before sending them to us. We could also give them an accurate amount of time we spent answering each question. The shape of the project changed, and so did the projects next door.

A year later, and having moved company and continent, I could not find that Yahoo Widget again. And after 5yrs I'm still unable to locate it. And it would be oh-so helpful.

So, this is my copy of that widget. Share and Enjoy!
